#### Cover change simulations 

These scripts create simulated time-series of vegetation cover (or population density) and then test statistical methods to recover the mechanistic drivers of cover change.  Cover is determined by population growth rates, density dependence and external environmental drivers.  The goal of the simulations is to test statistical methods for reconstructing the strength and direction of the effects of external environmental drivers on cover from retrospective time-series data.  These simulations are directly relevant to attempts to use time-series data to predict future dynamics of populations under climate change.
